# [Digital-Resume](https://ibilalkayy.github.io/digital-resume/)

This repository contains the code my digital resume. It shows my skillsets that I have and also the projects that I made.

It contains two directories that are **assets** and **style**. Assets contains my image and PDF of my resume. Style contains the *main.css* file in which all the styling is present.

There are five HTML files. The first one is the **index.html** file that contains the front page of my resume. The other four are the project files that contains the project data and relevant links.

## Here is the screenshot of my resume
