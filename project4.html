            <p>Virtual workspace will manage your projects and tasks virtually using a single platform. It is a project management software that will manage the tasks easily.</p>

            <p>The software is totally written in Go language. This repository contains six directories and in these six directories, many files are present that perform different functions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You can just give a project or task id and their names to get access to the account and make changes in it. </li>
                <li>The first directory is <b>database</b> that will handle the database stuff and I used MongoDB database in this code. The second directory is <b>entrance</b> that will handle the signup and login functionalities.</li>
                <li>The third directory is <b>profile</b> that will show the account information to the user. The fourth directory is <b>projectWork</b> that will handle all the projects and tasks.</li>
